        <h1>Cyber Security in August 2024</h1>
        <h2>TryHackMe attends Black Hat and DEF CON!</h2>
        <p>Earlier this month, the TryHackMe team attended Black Hat and DEF CON, met hundreds of businesses and users, handed out free swag, demoed upcoming releases (ðŸ˜‰) and interviewed wonderful users from our community!

            Weâ€™re already looking forward to next year, eager to return to Vegas with even more to offer. Until then, thank you to everyone who visited our booths, shared your TryHackMe success stories, and made this trip one for the books</p>
        <h2>"0.0.0.0 Day": 18-year-old vulnerability exposes all major browsers to security bypass</h2>
        <p>On the 8th of August 2024, researchers at Oligo Security uncovered a critical 18-year-old vulnerability, termed "0.0.0.0 Day," that affects all major web browsers, including Chromium, Firefox, and Safari.

            This flaw allows attackers to bypass browser security and interact with local network services, potentially leading to unauthorised access and remote code execution. The vulnerability exploits the IP address 0.0.0.0, typically used as a placeholder, to access local services across different browsers due to inconsistent security implementations.
            
            Despite responsible disclosure, the vulnerability remains partially unaddressed, with browser vendors working on fixes.</p>
